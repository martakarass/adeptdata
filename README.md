# adeptdata

Package `adeptdata` was created to host raw accelerometry data sets and
their derivatives. Some of them are used in the corresponding `adept`
package.

### Installation

Install from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("adeptdata")
```

### Data objects

##### `acc_running`

`acc_running` is a sample raw accelerometry data collected during 25
minutes of an outdoor run. Data were collected at frequency 100 Hz with
two ActiGraph GT9X Link sensors located at left hip and left ankle. See
`?acc_running` for details.

``` r
library(adeptdata)
head(acc_running)
#>     loc_id           date_time      x      y     z
#> 1 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.199 -1.012 0.133
#> 2 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.191 -1.027 0.133
#> 3 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.191 -1.035 0.121
#> 4 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.191 -1.027 0.109
#> 5 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.191 -1.016 0.109
#> 6 left_hip 2018-10-25 17:57:30 -0.184 -1.012 0.121
lubridate::tz(acc_running$date_time)
#> [1] "UTC"
```

##### `acc_walking_IU`

`acc_walking_IU` is a sample of raw accelerometry data collected during
outdoor continuous walking from 32 healthy participants between 23 and
52 years of age. Data were collected at frequency 100 Hz simultaneously
with four wearable accelerometers located at left wrist, left hip and
both ankles. See `?acc_walking_IU` for details.

``` r
head(acc_walking_IU)
#>      subj_id     loc_id time_s      x      y      z
#> 1 id86237981 left_wrist   0.00 -0.270 -0.773 -0.160
#> 2 id86237981 left_wrist   0.01 -0.266 -0.738 -0.172
#> 3 id86237981 left_wrist   0.02 -0.277 -0.707 -0.168
#> 4 id86237981 left_wrist   0.03 -0.277 -0.680 -0.160
#> 5 id86237981 left_wrist   0.04 -0.289 -0.656 -0.160
#> 6 id86237981 left_wrist   0.05 -0.316 -0.641 -0.164
```

##### `stride_template`

`stride_template` is a list containing walking stride pattern templates
derived from accelerometry data collected at four body locations: left
wrist, left hip, left ankle, and right ankle. See `?stride_template` for
details.

``` r
template <- list(stride_template$left_ankle[[2]][1, ],
                 stride_template$left_ankle[[2]][2, ])
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex = 1)
plot(template[[1]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left ankle: template 1")
plot(template[[2]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left ankle: template 2")
```
